# ESLint
## ESLint Rules

Sure, these are ESLint rules used to enforce certain coding styles and practices in your JavaScript or TypeScript code. Here’s what each of them means:

semi: ['error', 'never']: This rule enforces the omission of semicolons at the end of statements. If a semicolon is found, ESLint will throw an error. This is because some developers prefer to omit semicolons in JavaScript.
'comma-dangle': [2, 'never']: This rule disallows trailing commas in object and array literals. If a trailing comma is found, ESLint will throw an error. Trailing commas can make version control diffs cleaner by ensuring that adding or removing a line doesn’t result in other lines being marked as changed.
'react/jsx-filename-extension': [1, {extensions: ['.js', '.jsx']}]: This rule enforces the use of .js and .jsx extensions for files containing JSX syntax. If a file containing JSX has a different extension, ESLint will give a warning.
'no-use-before-define': ['error', {functions: true, classes: true, variables: false}]: This rule disallows the use of a variable before it is defined. It is set to throw an error if a function or a class is used before it is defined. However, it allows variables to be used before they are defined.
